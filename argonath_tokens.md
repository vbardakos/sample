# The Argonathian Syndicate

## Argonath Tokens
Argonath Tokens can be used for various purposes but they do not hold any monetary value out of the syndicate.
These coins can only be accepted in areas where the Syndicate operates and conventional currencies are not accepted.
There are four different types of tokens. The entry tokens, death, exchange and blood tokens.

### Entry Token
Entry tokens provide access to the Syndicate services and facilities. Also, they can be used as a proof
of being an active member. Access is granted by giving at least one entry token to the person you request a service.
If a person declines to help, then he is obliged to return the token and provide a reasonable explanation, which does
not come in conflict with the Syndicate ethics and his capabilities.

For example, a member innkeeper cannot decline access or provide information which cannot be used against the Syndicate.
Contrary, he can decline to provide information if it is against his personal interest, but he is obliged to provide
guidance on how to get this information if requested. Also, he can decline to do anything if another member
of the Syndicate is affected.

The purpose of entry tokens is to keep access under control. Members with low activity over time lose their right to
access and they either need to complete a contract to get new entry tokens.

### Death Tokens
Death Tokens are also known as "contracts". They are undetected magical coins and they can be either marked or unmarked.

Unmarked tokens can be requested from the Syndicate for free, but there is full record of ownership. Also, ownership
is engraved magically on each token, they are unusable by others and they do not hold any value. These tokens can
be used to prove completion of a future contract.

In contrast with unmarked tokens, marked tokens hold value but they can be usable only by their rightful owner.
A marked token proves the completion of a Syndicate task and it can be used anytime to claim the correspondent
contract reward. Usually members hold their marked tokens, since they are more compact than the rewards. Also, a token
can be used to get a part of the reward and keep the token. Although, if a reward is claimed fully, then the token loses
its mark.

If a contract involves an assassination, usually the death token is marked by the blood of the person. Although, if it
cannot be marked by blood, then the owner should specify in the contract how a contractor can prove the completion of
the task given. For example, if the task involves infiltration, the owner might request a particular item and the
contractor should provide it to the Syndicate officials in exchange of a marked token.
